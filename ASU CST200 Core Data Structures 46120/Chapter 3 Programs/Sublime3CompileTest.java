// * Update - it appears that Sublime can compile Java, and you 
// can see it in the window below (the build, if successful or not)
// However, it will not run the code. Only compile.
// That's okay with me for now. I'm not sure I care either way. 
// Running "java whateverthefileis" doesn't bother me in terminal.
