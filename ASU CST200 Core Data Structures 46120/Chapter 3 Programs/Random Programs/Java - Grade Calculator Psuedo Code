Java - Grade Calculator Pseudo Code

Used for application

import scanner class

create class

main method

declare variables:
	String student;	For student name
	int assignments;		How many assignments the user wishes to enter a grade for
	int count				For holding how many iterations are performed
	double calcGrade;	For calculating grade (user can enter as a double, ie 87.5)
	


	create scanner object

	Get student name from user
	assign name to student
--
	Create loop with "assignments" iterations
	Get assignment number 1 (count = 1) grade
	add grade to calcGrade

	Get assignment number 2 (count = 2) grade
	add grade to calcGrade

	Repeat until loop finishes all iterations
--
	
	calcGrade = calcGrade / count;

	if calcGrade >= 90.0
		calcGrade = "A"
	else if calcGrade >= 80.00
		calcGrade = "B"
	else if calcGrade >= 70.00
		calcGrade = "C"
	else if calcGrade >= 60.0
		calcGrade = "D"
	else
		calcGrade = "E"

	Display student and calcGrade
